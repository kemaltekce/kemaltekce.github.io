      <description>We have a goal. We want to learn. The first thing we do is create a plan. In self-learning, we most often look for an online course that matches what we want to learn. Ideally, they already have divided the curriculum into multiple weeks with timestamps on how long each material takes. We take it and our planning is done.
But then we miss one material. We try to keep up with the content and don’t take time to fill gaps in our understanding.</description>

      <description>There are differences between traditional education and Montessori education. One of them is dominating at our schools and also made their way heavily into online learning. Online learning is more and more content-focused — losing their learners along the way. The Montessori approach has a lot to offer for how we teach our children. But maybe it is also the secret to improve online learning and self-learning. Instead of a top-down education where the educator tells the student what to learn, the Montessori method embraces a more free and flexible style of learning.</description>

      <description>When we learn, we have the goal of mastering a skill. We want to become the expert. Sadly, because of these expecations we don’t see learning as a journey towards mastery.
We avoid trying, experimenting, and making mistakes. We just don’t want to look stupid. But if we truly want to learn we have to make mistakes. Like Ray Congdon said:
“Anything worth doing well is worth doing poorly at first.</description>

      <description>Everyone and everything is fighting for our attention. And, we try to keep up with everything. We try to consume more and more to stay in touch with everyone. We try to do more and more just to feel productive.
We divide our attention across so many things; which sadly means nothing is getting the attention it deserves, and it makes us feel terrible.
This is not only true for our private and professional life but also for our learning.</description>

      <description>We like being comfortable — especially in our learning. We read what we are already familiar with. We revisit what we already know. We practice what we’ve already mastered. This feels nice. It feels like we are learning so much. But sadly, we keep up an illusion. And this can be devastating.
We try to avoid discomfort. We don’t like exposing gaps in our knowledge. We almost hate facing obstacles. They make us anxious.</description>

      <description>The number of available online courses is increasing. Universities are offering lectures online. Schools are testing remote lessons. All in all, remote as well as self-learning is rising and with it the importance of proper self-feedback during learning.
Feedback is essential for learning. But it is hard to include feedback properly during learning and even harder during self-learning.
You might have prepared some notes and you are learning by self-quizzing and self-explaining.</description>

      <description>Often, we only engage in shallow learning. We decide to learn something new. We, for example, choose a new online course or join a new Bootcamp program to learn a new skill. We are excited and want to learn. But in the end, we only rush through the materials. We try to take notes but end up taking transcripts. Our learning ends up shallow.
This shallow learning creates a feeling of frustration.</description>

      <description>I took a bunch of online courses from an Introduction to Psychology course to a Design Principles course. From a UX Design course to an Artificial intelligence course. There is one thing I learnt for sure — learning is difficult. I always had the feeling that my learning process wasn’t the best —and it probably still isn’t. There was always something that is missing. I either rushed the materials and didn’t take the time to understand the mentioned ideas or I took the time to understand but didn’t use the ideas in a personal project.</description>

      <description>Do you ever have the feeling of perplexity when you are learning something and you think “I should know this. I’ve just read it. Why can’t I remember?”
This is because of the illusion of knowledge. And I fall into this trap almost every time I read. I just have to turn the page and I immediately forget what I just read.
Itis easy to fall into the “illusion of knowledge” trap.</description>

      <description>I grab my Kindle and go to our balcony. It’s time to read a bit. I’m currently reading “A Mind For Numbers”. It contains a ton of interesting insights regarding learning. So I’m highlighting, highlighting, and highlighting.
Later, after I’m done reading, I’ll transfer all the highlights to Notion.
It is a great feeling to find new insightful information. It feels surprising and familiar at the same time. So naturally, I want to hold on to the insight.</description>

      <description>I pick up my phone and start scrolling through Medium. I’m looking for articles on how to improve my learning. And let’s be honest: there is a ton of articles out there. I already read a few books and watched a few YouTube videos regarding learning, looking for more and more learning hacks. While scrolling I remember. I saved an article yesterday about 5 skills to learn; and one of these skills was learning.</description>

      <description>I’m back in the office. I’m back in front of the problem I avoided for the last couple of days. Luckily I was busy with other tasks. Luckily I had to take care of other problems first. But now there is no getting around it anymore.
I avoided it because I have never faced a problem like this before. I don’t have the skills to solve it fast. I first have to read and learn a bit more about it.</description>

      <description>I just had breakfast and now it’s time for learning. Super excited. I go to my desk. I open my laptop, I open up Notion — my favourite note-taking app — , and I open the UX Design online course which I’m currently doing on Coursera.
I’m super excited because I want to learn more about UX Design. I’m curious and I think it might be helpful in the future. Maybe one day I’ll find it useful for my job or for my own products.</description>

      <description>It is Friday morning. It is my learning day. I wake up. Get ready. And start learning. I enjoy learning new skills. This time I want to learn more about creating websites. My goal is to build a digital bullet journal prototype.
At least this was the plan. The last couple of Fridays I struggled with learning. I’m either lacking the energy, or I’m getting distracted easily, or I’m planning too much for the day.</description>
