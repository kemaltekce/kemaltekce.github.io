    <h1>How to increase your reading speed?</h1>
    <div>
        <article class="green"><p>Do you like reading books? Are you eager to read more and absorb all the great insights? Do you watch YouTube videos in which your favourite content creators talk about all the books they are reading and you want to keep up?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, and yes. To achieve all this, I thought “maybe I have to increase my reading speed.”. So I sat down and watched — a few more YouTube videos about how to read faster. But maybe I was wrong all along.</p>
<p>Why do I even want to read more? To learn more. But reading more only means consuming more and not necessarily learning more or even learning something. Thus reading more wouldn’t improve my situation because I wouldn’t learn more. I would just consume. Which would be a big waste of time.</p>
<p>So if increasing my reading speed is not going to solve my problem, what is?</p>
<p>I tried to increase my reading speed to read faster and more but as the stoics already realized it is not about how many books you go through but how many books go through you. This has to be a quote from someone. It is too good and catchy not to be a quote but I don’t remember who said it.</p>
<p>So this means, we shouldn’t sacrifice reading faster for reading intentionally. To read for growth and learning, read intentionally, think about what you read, and make connections between old insights and new insights.</p>
<p>It is ok to read slowly.</p>
<p>Maybe I just think this to make myself feel better because I’m not a fast reader. But as always, there is not one hack to everything. You have to find a balance between fast and slow reading. Skimming and understanding.</p>
<p>So don’t try to read faster and more at all costs. Pause and reflect and think about what you just read for lasting change, growth, and learning.</p>
<hr>
<p>I started thinking about this after listening to a daily stoic podcast from Ryan Holiday.</p>
