        <article class="white"><p>I’m back in the office. I’m back in front of the problem I avoided for the last couple of days. Luckily I was busy with other tasks. Luckily I had to take care of other problems first. But now there is no getting around it anymore.</p>
<p>I avoided it because I have never faced a problem like this before. I don’t have the skills to solve it fast. I first have to read and learn a bit more about it. This means I will make mistakes, which makes me anxious.</p>
<p>Learning is a skill that is becoming more and more important. Learning does not stop after school. It does not stop after university. Our life is constantly changing. Our interests may change too. We will face new obstacles. All of this can create a feeling of uncertainty and anxiety in us.</p>
<p>One way to deal with this is by learning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn&rdquo; — Alvin Toffler</p>
<p>Let’s face change, uncertainty, and obstacles with an eagerness to learn.
Once I accepted that this is something new, that this is a learning opportunity, that obstacles are a great place to learn, the anxiety got less. I was more motivated to face the obstacle and grow. Even if it means making mistakes along the way. In the end, mistakes build our experience and are essential to learning.</p>
