    <h1>Hero’s learning journey.</h1>
    <div>
        <article class="white"><p>While learning more about writing and storytelling styles, I came across the hero’s journey storytelling method. While reading about the hero’s journey, I started to think whether or not the hero’s journey is the journey we take — or ideally, we should take — for learning.</p>
<p>The hero’s journey — or our learning journey — often starts with realizing the mundane reality and discovering a new mysterious world. In our case, the mysterious world is a topic which catches our interest.</p>
<p>This realization is often the calling for an adventure. For learning a new skill. We get excited. We are super curious. We are motivated. But at the same time, we may get some setback. Going on this new adventure and learning a new skill means leaving our comfort zone. We start doubting. We get anxious. We feel uncertain.</p>
<p>Enter the mentor. In our cases a friend, a person we admire, or simply an online course we find interesting. This “mentor” gives us certainty, motivates us to take on the journey, and helps us learn the first set of skills and wisdom.</p>
<p>Most learning journeys just stop here. They at least stop here for me a lot of times. It left me with an unsatisfied feeling. A feeling that I didn’t grow as expected. I never could figure out what is missing. Maybe the hero’s journey opened my eyes. Maybe the next part was missing all along from my learning journeys.</p>
<p>Equipped with our motivation, basic skills, and first wisdom, we cross the first threshold and start the real learning journey. Until now this was only the beginning. Until now we were mostly in familiar territory. Until now we only prepared for the real journey to come.</p>
<p>Now it is time. Now we enter the unknown. In our learning journey, the unknown is most often a project we want to start — a program we want to code, a blog we want to write. So, we start to practice and apply our knowledge. We encounter obstacles and tests to solve and overcome. We share what we know and what we are working on. We encounter friends but according to the hero’s journey also enemies.</p>
<p>And like this, we take our journey and take one step at the time. At some point in our journey, we are confronted with the ultimate obstacle — our biggest fear. This is the critical moment we have to overcome to become real heroes in our learning journey. This ultimate obstacle can be different for everyone. If you have learnt how to write, it might be publishing your articles. If you have learnt how to draw, it might be sharing your art. If you have learnt how to program, it might be making your product available to others.</p>
<p>But we have to share what we’ve learnt and created if we want to be the hero in our journey. Only by sharing we can see what resonates with others and what creates value for them, and thus for us.</p>
<p>After we have overcome our biggest fear, we can see the fruits of our work. We can see the reward for which we have fought in our journey.</p>
<p>But the journey isn’t over. Now comes the road back. You’ve learnt. You’ve grown. But how will you move forward from this point on? How will this new skill fit into your life? How will your reward influence you? How will this new skill make you a better person? This will be a time of reflection.</p>
<p>After this final test, after this reflection, we will finally return home. We will return from our learning journey matured, grown, a different person. We now will have truly learnt with more knowledge about the unknown world. And we can plan our next adventure.</p>
