          Hello and welcome to my forecast visualization.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to visualize forecasted data so that the
          engineer or user can analyse and understand the machine learning (ML)
          model's capabilities and limits. Besides, I also wanted to learn more
          about D3.js.
        </p>
        <h3 class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">The data</h3>
        <p>
          The data you see in this project is the
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand" class="has-text-weight-bold chunky_underline">bikesharing</a>
          dataset from Kaggle. The ML goal was to build a forecasting model that
          predicts the demand of bikes for a given date and hourly time. Below
          you can see the <span class="has-text-weight-bold" style="color: #688BAB">target</span>,
          <span class="has-text-weight-bold" style="color: #E25A42">prediction</span>
          as well as <span class="has-text-weight-bold" style="color: #95A17E">error</span>
          as line plots. Furthermore, additonal features - besides datetime
          features - that the model used are displayed as barplot -
          <span class="has-text-weight-bold" style="color: #f8ba91">Monday to Friday</span>
          and <span class="has-text-weight-bold" style="color: #635F5D">weekends</span> -
          and horizontal line plots -
          <span class="has-text-weight-bold" style="color: #635F5D">workingday</span>/<span class="has-text-weight-light" style="color: #635F5D">no-workingday</span>
          and
          <span class="has-text-weight-bold" style="color: #635F5D">holiday</span>/<span class="has-text-weight-light" style="color: #635F5D">no-holiday</span>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">The machine learning model</h3>
        <p>
          The ML model is a basic Random Forest (RF) model and was implemented
          using the ML library <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html" class="has-text-weight-bold chunky_underline">sklearn</a>
          and its great pipeline structure.
          The best RF model was selected via grid search. To ensure that the
          grid search runs with the correct forward moving splits, because we have
          a time series data at hand, the <a href="https://github.com/kemaltekce/sklearn_forward_time_series_split" class="has-text-weight-bold chunky_underline">ForwardTimeSeriesSplit</a>
          was used. After the best model was selected, the question was how good
          the final model is. For this, a forward-test was run using the
          <a href="https://github.com/kemaltekce/sklearn_forward_time_series_split" class="has-text-weight-bold chunky_underline">ForwardTimeSeriesSplit</a>
          again and a holdout dataset, which the grid search hasn't seen before.
          The resulting predictions from the forward test are visualized below.
          The model itself isn't perfect, and can and should be further optimized.
          The visualizations below can be used to analyse the forecasts and
          formulate new questions and hypotheses to further improve the model.
