    <h1>struggles.</h1>
    <div>
        <article class="white"><p>It is Friday morning. It is my learning day. I wake up. Get ready. And start learning. I enjoy learning new skills. This time I want to learn more about creating websites. My goal is to build a digital bullet journal prototype.</p>
<p>At least this was the plan. The last couple of Fridays I struggled with learning. I’m either lacking the energy, or I’m getting distracted easily, or I’m planning too much for the day.</p>
<p>This totally destroys the process of enjoying learning and reaching the goal I want.</p>
<p>Our personal struggles can make it difficult to enjoy learning. They can even keep us from learning in the first place.</p>
<p>So let’s deal with our struggles.</p>
<p>Name it. The first step in dealing with struggles is to define and name them. Write down your struggles. Become aware of them. It doesn’t help to include and implement a simple solution in your life only because it is fancy. It has to be helpful for your situation and struggle.</p>
<p>Mine are…</p>
<ul>
<li>lack of energy.</li>
<li>difficulty focusing.</li>
<li>overwhelmed by taking on too much.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep the list short for now. Don’t take on too much. Concentrate on the top two or three struggles.</p>
<p>Small simple solutions. Now that we know what we mostly struggle with let’s look for small simple solutions. The solutions that helped me — after some research, tests, and iterations — are:</p>
<ul>
<li>start for just 1 minute.</li>
<li>mental focus follows visual focus.</li>
<li>be a time pessimist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lack of energy. My small simple solution for this is to just start for 1 minute. Sometimes the beginning is the hardest part. It is easier for me to motivate myself to learn just for 1 minute than 1 hour. But after 1 minute, I often feel a rush of energy and I keep going.</p>
<p>Difficulty to focus. This simple solution is from the @hubermanlab . To focus mentally we can often use our vision; and focus visually first. Focus with your vision on a small area. Keep your visual focus. Create a visual cone. Your mental focus will follow and you won’t get distracted easily.</p>
<p>This is also why smartphones work so great. They restrict our vision to a very small area. Once our visual focus is set everybody around us gets annoyed because we don’t listen to them anymore. Like when my wife get’s annoyed with me.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by taking on too much. To solve this struggle, I’m trying to be a time pessimist. Instead of being realistic about my time estimations, I am pessimistic. Instead of estimating 30 minutes — because the online tutorial is 30 minutes long — , I’ll estimate 2 hours. This way I take on less. I can focus properly without feeling overwhelmed. And let’s be honest — things always take way longer than we have planned.</p>
<p>These are my struggles and my attempts to deal with them. What are your struggles with learning and what are your small simple solutions?</p>
