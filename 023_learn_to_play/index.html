    <h1>learn to play. play to learn.</h1>
    <div>
        <article class="white"><p>As a child, we had this natural curiosity and natural discipline. Everything seemed like a mystery and we were curious about it. We learnt a lot by being immersed in what we were doing.</p>
<p>Nowadays learning feels like a drill. It is forced. We force ourselves. We turned our natural discipline into an unnaturally forced discipline. The reason might be that we lost touch with playing.</p>
<p>We lost our playfulness and became more work-full. We focus on finishing the work. On finishing the tutorial. On finishing the lecture. We don’t play anymore with what we learn.</p>
<p>I don’t mean we literally have to play like a child again. But we should rediscover our playful attitude. Learning with a playful attitude will spark your interest and curiosity. It will give you energy and motivation to keep going.</p>
<p>With a playful attitude, you might even rediscover your natural discipline. You might enjoy building a deeper understanding of what you are learning. And all of this without feeling to force or drill it.</p>
<p>You might be asking yourself “But how do I learn to play again?”.</p>
<p>One. Don’t be judgemental of yourself. Don’t think you are stupid because you don’t understand. Don’t think you are a failure because you made mistakes. Mistakes are there to learn from. Taking time to understand is important.</p>
<p>Even allow yourself to get frustrated. Frustration is fine as long as you come back. Don’t hold onto it for too long.</p>
<p>Two. Ask “How can I play with this?”. Find elements in learning that feel like playing. During my studies, I collected information on a lot of papers. Distilled it. And organized it on one big piece of paper. I had to leave things away and focus on main points. I thought about how to put everything onto one sheet. It felt like a puzzle. It felt like playing.</p>
<p>Because of this, I had to go deeper in my understanding. And anything gets more interesting if you gain a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>I also made mistakes and had to throw away a complete sheet because of a writing mistake or because not everything fit onto it. A bit frustrating, but it was okay.</p>
<p>If you ask “How might I play with this?”, it transforms big scary obstacles into nice challenges to learn from.</p>
<p>Three. Apply and use what you learn. If possible, try to apply and make use of what you are learning. Have a project to apply your knowledge. Give yourself the opportunity to test and tinker.</p>
<p>Sadly, since my studies, I lost more and more of my playfulness in learning. I started just watching online tutorials and educational content. I only took notes in form of transcribing what is being said. I rarely reviewed notes, thought about insights, tried to connect new knowledge to old knowledge. My learning just turned into consumption. It was work. I just wanted to get it over with.</p>
<p>I’m trying to rediscover my playfulness. Now I have my learning system in Notion. I plan and shape my learning. I keep track of my progress. I take time to understand and write notes by rephrasing insights. I define and work on learning projects. I track my curiosity and questions to spark my interest each day.</p>
<p>The three points above helped me to rediscover playing again. I hope it will help you, too.</p>
