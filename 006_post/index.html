        <article class="white"><p>Are you excited to learn? Did you find an interesting online-course? With motivation and excitement, you start learning. But after some time the initial spark fades away? Learning feels like a burden? Almost like it became the source that drains your energy?</p>
<p>You ask yourself: <em>What happened? Wasn’t I excited about this?</em></p>
<p>This happened to me. And I think a more flexible and open-space learning approach might fix this problem.</p>
<p>When planning on learning something new via for example an online course — like I often do with Coursera — , we check the course materials, the length of the course, and the amount of estimated time. We plan rigorously to spend a certain amount of hours a week on the course. In this setting, we can then often take two possible paths; but sadly with the same outcome.</p>
<p>First, we follow the course as planned. We almost race through the course to keep up with the plan we made. We don’t allow us to pause, fill gaps of understanding, or follow our curiosity. This results in frustration because we didn’t take the time to understand.</p>
<p>Second, we follow our curiosity and take time to really understand what we are learning. But this time wasn’t accounted for in our initial plan. Thus, we don’t finish the course in our expected time, leaving us again frustrated.</p>
<p>By planning our learning it is almost impossible to feel satisfied by learning itself. You can only plan your learning to a certain point — which is why I prefer the phrase shaping your learning. You can only shape learning because you don’t know yet what you will encounter. You don’t know what you will understand and where you have to go deeper. You don’t know what new thing might spark your curiosity.</p>
<p>We have to realize that learning can’t be planned — it can only be shaped. Learning is an art. It needs space and flexibility.</p>
<p>The flexibility allows you to follow your curiosity, explore, and take the time to really understand. Learning becomes playful again. This also raises your focus and motivation. Before, learning drained energy. Now it is a source that creates energy.</p>
<p>But don’t make it too flexible. Otherwise, you might drift away from your original learning. Explore and play. Don’t get distracted and anxious.</p>
<p>You can create open space and flexibility in your learning journey by being a time pessimist (see link at the end). Plan in open spaces of time for unknown parameters like obstacles and curiosities.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t need time. You can use the time to either repeat what you already learnt and practice or move on to the next topic. The only thing that can happen is that you finish your learning earlier. Which is a much better feeling than not finishing it in time.</p>
<p>So let’s shape our learning in a flexible and open manner so that curiosity, insight, and understanding can flourish.</p>
