    <h1>Rediscovering rereading as a learning method.</h1>
    <div>
        <article class="white"><p>How do you read books? How do you catch insights from books? How do you learn from books? Do you read, highlight, and take notes? At some point, you might want to repeat what you read to process, understand, and learn. But what are good learning techniques to accomplish this?</p>
<p>Self-testing and active recall. Both help you challenge your understanding, spot gaps in your understanding, and guide you in your learning process.</p>
<p>What about rereading? A method we all do from time to time; if we are honest. Rereading, however, will only create the illusion of understanding. Our brain will think it recalled the information but it didn’t. We showed our brain the insight right away. Because of this rereading is labelled as a bad learning method, which we should neglect, abandon, almost hate. But is it really that bad?</p>
<p>Nowadays, the trend for reading books is: read fast; read a lot. If we want to read fast and read a lot, it will be hard to find time to pause and use recall, self-testing, and thinking to understand what we read. But we have to. Otherwise, we are only consuming insights, without understanding it. Which is — sadly — just a waste of time.</p>
<p>So let’s say we take the time to pause and recall what we read. Good. We laid the ground for our initial understanding. Great. We made initial connections to other ideas we already have. Perfect. But the trend — read fast; read a lot; power through — is still sitting in our neck. Which, even if we recalled and challenged our understanding, pushes us to the next thing. This might result only in shallow understanding.</p>
<p>And here rereading comes into action. Rereading has its place in learning. Not for initial understanding or understanding at all. But for deeper learning. If you read, take notes, and recall what you read, you are creating an initial understanding — the base. Rereading, now, will help you see new insights, things that didn’t catch your attention in the first place. You will look at things differently because you learnt and did grow. Noticing them, taking notes of them, and again using recalling will expand your understanding. You will move from shallow understanding to deeper understanding. You will catch insights to build on top of your base.</p>
<p>Therefore, we shouldn’t abandon rereading all together. Rereading is a revision of our first interpretation.</p>
