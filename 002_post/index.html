    <h1>What memorization experts can teach us about learning.</h1>
    <div>
        <article class="white"><p>This might not be what you expect. This is not about a fancy memorization technique like the memory palace that experts use. It is something much more simple and elegant which could change how we should learn. It is what is behind the memory palace. The fundamental thing we as humans are actually primed to do but almost never do if it comes to true learning.</p>
<p>We all want to learn and improve and grow. I certainly want to but sometimes it feels like I’m not really learning. Because of that, I feel anxiety, frustration, almost disbelief in myself. That’s why I learnt how to learn.</p>
<p>I learnt about learning techniques like active recall, interleaving, spaced repetition. All of them have something to them and could be discussed separately. Especially spaced repetition. But this is another topic. Still, despite using these techniques, I felt like something is missing.</p>
<p>And what might be missing is what memorization experts try to show us. Memorization experts memorize a series of numbers not by remembering isolated numbers but by associating numbers with real-life things and place them into a story. Then they learn the story; not the actual series. So what they do is give meaningless numbers meaning and build a story around them.</p>
<p>And this is what might be missing from learning. Meaning. We are made for stories. We are inspired by stories. We just love stories.</p>
<p>Thus, while learning, we shouldn’t just try to memorize isolated facts and insights. We should make meaningful connections to what we already know. We should build a chain of meaningful connections between what we learn and what we’ve learnt. This chain becomes our story. Through this story, we will be able to retain and retrieve more. Let’s create meaningful connections, chains, and networks to learn with intention.</p>
