        <article class="white"><p>Do you have a huge to-do list day in day out? Does your to-do list contain things that you have to do and things you want to do? Things that you are curious and passionate about? But you don’t get them all done? Isn’t that frustrating?</p>
<p>I plan to read, write, take notes, code, and learn something new. To be able to cross out these to-dos I do a little bit of everything and busy around half-hearted. And it doesn’t feel great.</p>
<p>We plan time and try to make time for certain to-dos but the truth is that we can’t make time. We can only take time. The question then becomes “How much time do we want to take?”.</p>
<p>Often there isn’t enough time because we plan like time optimists. We think about the ideal amount of time some activity will take — I’ll read 15 pages in 30 minutes. But this is never true. It always takes longer. Which results in doing things half-hearted — oh this point was interesting, let me think about it, but I only have 5 minutes left and still 10 pages to read, ok skip thinking and focus on just reading.</p>
<p>So the solution is to plan more like time realists. Again no. We are terrible at making real-time estimates.</p>
<p>We have to be time pessimists. Doubling, tripling, almost quadrupling our time estimated. Only if we do this, we will focus on less. By focusing on less, we will do things full-hearted. Only by doing things full-hearted, we will feel great at the end of the day. We will feel great, passionate, and like we acted and did things that truly mattered by just taking time.</p>
